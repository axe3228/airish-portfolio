                    I was a Junior Graphics Designer at ADA Digital Philippines INC. for almost 2 years. During those times, 
                    I served as the dedicated designer for Kao (2020), Revlon (2021), Ryo (2021-2022), mise en sc√®ne (2021-2022) 
                    and innisfree (2022). I was able to work closely with clients and senior designers, and have successfully handled small and big campaigns.
